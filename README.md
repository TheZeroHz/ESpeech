## Supported Boards
- ESP32 S3 (Successfully Tested)
- ESP32 DOIT Devkit V1 (Under Test)

## Features
- Faster and LightWeight
- No need Of any Accounts,Credit Card or API key.
- Upload audio files for transcription.
- Uses `speech_recognition` library for speech-to-text conversion.
- Simple Flask web server to handle file uploads and return transcriptions.

## Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
### Server Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or later installed.
- `pip` package installer.
- Internet connection for installing dependencies.
### ESP32 Requirements

- I2S MIC (INMP-441)

## Install server dependencies   
- download and install python if not installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **open CMD on windows**  [Linux user open terminal & Run Equivalent Commands]
- ```sh
    pip3 install flask
    ```
- ```sh
